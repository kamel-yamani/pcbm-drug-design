In this project, I developed machine learning models to identify new inhibitors against various cancer targets for the Physical Chemistry and Biology of Materials laboratory. The goal was to build mathematical models that could identify small molecules as inhibitors against five selected cancer-related protein targets: LcK, FLT-3, ERBB1, ERBB2, and HDAC1. Inhibition of these proteins can stop the growth of cancer cells. My work involved data cleaning and processing, extraction of relevant attributes, and using XGBoost to train models on the provided datasets.
